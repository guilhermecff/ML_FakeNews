# Fake News Detection

## Overview
The Fake News Detection project aims to tackle the pervasive issue of misinformation by developing a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a news article is fake or real. Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle, which consists of pre-labeled news articles, the project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques Machine Learning algorithms to achieve this goal.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes a diverse collection of news articles labeled as either fake or real. This dataset is crucial for training and evaluating the performance of our machine learning models.

## Machine Learning Model
The core of this project is the Logistic Regression model used for fake news detection. After thorough data preprocessing, the Logistic Regression model is trained on the dataset. This model was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification tasks.

### Model Performance
The Logistic Regression model achieves an impressive 97% accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between fake and real news articles.
